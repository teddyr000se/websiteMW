## Description ##

This plugin adds a new color scheme called "GoDaddy" to the User Profile area inside the WordPress Admin.

It is beneficial to users who manage sites on multiple hosts because they can easily identify which ones are on GoDaddy Managed WordPress simply by observing the color scheme.

The new color scheme option is NOT selected by default, it is simply made available as an additional choice on the User Profile screen and must be selected by the user.
