Helping users launch their new WordPress site in just a few clicks.

== Description ==

The WP Easy Mode plugin is designed to help users (especially those new to WordPress) get their site up and running in just a few easy steps.

By default, these steps are:

1. Start - Are you new to WordPress or a seasoned pro?
2. Settings - Set basic options like the site title and tagline.
3. Theme - Browse through the top free themes from WordPress.org.

Bonus: Behind the scenes, WP Easy Mode will use GeoIP detection to automatically set the Timezone String and Start of Week settings in WordPress. We call them "Smart Defaults".
